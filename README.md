# Multi Text Editor

Say goodbye to one-by-one text edits. Multi Text Editor is the ultimate tool for managing and editing multiple text layers and frame names at once in Figma.

Designed for designers and teams who value efficiency, this plugin eliminates repetitive work and frees up your time for creativity.

## Key Features

**Bulk Text Editing:** Select as many text layers as you want and edit them all in a single, organized interface.

**Bulk Frame Renaming:** Change the names of multiple frames with the same ease, keeping your project consistently organized.

**Smart Finder:** Find specific text across your page with the "Find and Replace" function. With support for `case-sensitive` searches and a real-time preview, you have full control over every change.

**Advanced Formatting Rules:** Create patterns to rename your texts in bulk. Use tokens like `{current_text}` to keep the original text, `{1-9}` for sequential numbering, and more.

**Source Lock:** Set one text layer as the "source" and apply its content to all other selected layers with a single click. Ideal for standardizing buttons, labels, and other components.

**Undo:** Made a change by mistake? The "Undo" button reverts the last bulk action—whether it was a replacement or an applied change—ensuring you can work with complete confidence.

## How to Use

1.  **Select:** Choose the Text or Frame layers you want to change. (Tip: Hold `Ctrl+Shift` for precise layer selection).
2.  **Run:** Open the plugin (`Plugins > Multi Text Editor`).
3.  **Edit:** Use the "Texts," "Frames," or "Finder" tabs to make your changes.
4.  **Apply:** Click **Apply →** and watch the magic happen across all your selected layers!
